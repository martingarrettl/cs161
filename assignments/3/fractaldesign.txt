n rows above middle row
n rows below middle row
middle row is only row with all n *
every odd row has a single *

The problem is asking me to design a recursive function that takes
integers n and c and returns a pattern to the console comprised of
asterisks and spaces based on the values of n and c.

      *

when n=7 and c=0.
