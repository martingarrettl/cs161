Problem Statement:

Write a C++ program which takes user defined variables:
monthly salary, # of months worked, cost of car, # of cars sold, misconducts observed, tax year, and state of operation.

using these variables the program must then calculate the users gross income, taxes owed, and finally their net income

Problem Analysis:

The program must start with the user defining 7 individual variables of types
int: salary, months, car cost, cars sold, misconduct and tax year
char: workstate

In addition to the user defined variables, to increase the readability of the code
we will need to initialize several others.
int: annual, deduction, grossincome, avgsale
float: random, profit, taxrate;


I am assuming the user will use valid inputs
I am assuming the user is only responsible for selling one model of car
I am assuming the user

Plan/Design:

//get user inputs
ask user to input values for months worked, monthly salary, cost of car,
# of cars sold, # of misconducts, the tax year and the state they worked in

//calculate gross income
annualincome = months work * monthly salary
average car sale = car cost * (1 + randomly generated % between 5 & 10)
profit = cars sold * (average car sale * car cost)

if "misconducts > 0"
  deduction = 100 * 2^(misconducts - 1)

gross income = annual + (profit * 2%) - deduction

//calculate tax based on year and state
if "taxyear == 2017"
  if "state == A"
    tax = calculate state A 2017 tax
  else if "state == B"
     if "state b 2017 tax bracket 1 requirement"
        tax = calculate state b 2017 bracket 1 taxes
     else
        tax = calculate state b 2017 bracket 2 taxes
  else
     if "state c 2017 tax bracket 1 requirement"
        tax = calculate state c 2017 bracket 1 taxes
     else if "state b 2017 tax bracket 2 requirement"
        tax = calculate state c 2017 bracket 2 taxes
     else
        tax = calculate state c 2017 bracket 3 taxes

else if "taxyear == 2018"
  if "state == A"
    tax = calculate state A 2018 tax
  else if "state == B"
     if "state b 2018 tax bracket 1"
        tax = calculate state b 2018 bracket 1 taxes
     else
        tax = calculate state b 2018 bracket 2 taxes
  else
     if "state c 2018 tax bracket 1"
        tax = calculate state c 2018 bracket 1 taxes
     else if "state b 2018 tax bracket 2"
        tax = calculate state c 2018 bracket 2 taxes
     else
        tax = calculate state c 2018 bracket 3 taxes
  else
    print "Invalid tax year provided."

//display gross income, tax, and calculate net net income
print "average selling price is $ " + avgsale << "for which you earn 2% of the profit on " + car_sold + "cars sold, which is $" + profit * 0.02"
print "Your gross income is: $" + grossincome
print "The tax you need to pay is: $" + taxrate
print "Your remaining income is: $" + (grossincome - taxrate)
