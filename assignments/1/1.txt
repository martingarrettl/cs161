Problem Statement:

Problem Analysis:

Plan/Design:

This program will calculate a users gross income, yearly tax and finally their
net income.

//get user inputs
ask user to input values for months worked, monthly salary, cost of car,
# of cars sold, # of misconducts, the tax year and the state they worked in

//calculate gross income
annualincome = months work * monthly salary
average car sale = car cost * (1 + randomly generated % between 5 & 10)
profit = cars sold * (average car sale * car cost)

deduction = 0
if "misconducts > 0"
  deduction = 100 * 2^(misconducts - 1)

gross income = annual + (profit * 2%) - deduction

//calculate tax based on year and state
if "tax year 2017"
  if "state == A"
    tax = calculate state A 2017 tax
  else if "state == B"
     if "state b 2017 tax bracket 1 requirement"
        tax = calculate state b 2017 bracket 1 taxes
     else
        tax = calculate state b 2017 bracket 2 taxes
  else
     if "state c 2017 tax bracket 1 requirement"
        tax = calculate state c 2017 bracket 1 taxes
     else if "state b 2017 tax bracket 2 requirement"
        tax = calculate state c 2017 bracket 2 taxes
     else
        tax = calculate state c 2017 bracket 3 taxes

else if "tax year 2018"
  if "state == A"
    tax = calculate state A 2018 tax
  else if "state == B"
     if "state b 2018 tax bracket 1"
        tax = calculate state b 2018 bracket 1 taxes
     else
        tax = calculate state b 2018 bracket 2 taxes
  else
     if "state b 2018 tax bracket 1"
        tax = calculate state b 2018 bracket 1 taxes
     else if "state b 2018 tax bracket 2"
        tax = calculate state b 2018 bracket 2 taxes
     else
        tax = calculate state b 2018 bracket 3 taxes

//display gross income, tax, and calculate net net income
print "average selling price is $ " + av
