Problem Analysis:

Plan/Design:

This program will calculate a users gross income, yearly tax and finally their
net income.

//get user inputs
ask user to input values for months worked, monthly salary, cost of car,
# of cars sold, # of misconducts, the tax year and the state they worked in

//calculate gross income
annualincome = months work * monthly salary
average car sale = car cost * (1 + randomly generated % between 5 & 10)
profit = cars sold * (average car sale * car cost)

deduction = 0
if "misconducts > 0"
  deduction = 100 * 2^(misconducts - 1)

gross income = annual + (profit * 2%) - deduction

//calculate tax based on year and state
if "tax year 2017"
  if "state == A"
    tax = calculate state A 2017 tax
  else if "state == B"
    tax = calculate state B 2017 tax
  else
    tax = calculate state C 2017 tax

else if "tax year 2018"
  if "state == A"
    tax = calculate state A 2018 tax
  else if "state == B"
    tax = calculate state B 2018 tax
  else
    tax = calculate state C 2018 tax

//display gross income, tax, and calculate net net income
print "average selling price is $ " + av
