1. if user enters 5, how many times will factorial be executed:
    5 times. initial, 5-1, 5-2, 5-3, 5-4.

2. What if line 1 is missing?
  if line 1 is missing you're going to get a compile error because
  factorial() wont be defined by the time it gets called in main().

3. what if "if (n==1) return 1" is missing.
  compile error because of the else statement
  or if that's also missing then the function will keep calling itself
  well into the -n range.

4. There is an int variable n in main function and an int n in factorial.
    are they the same?

    Nah, but they do end up being the same value. When the function is called
    you're assigning the function's n as the same value as the main()'s n.
